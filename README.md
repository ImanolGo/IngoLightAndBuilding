# IngoLightAndBuilding

The aim is to engage visitors with the installation at the fair as well as with the Ingo Maurer social media presence. Participants are encouraged to take pictures of the booth at L&B 2018 and/or Luminale and post it on Instagram.
The visualisations on the LED ceiling mines instagram hashtags related to Ingo Maurer. Everytime someone uses a related hashtag an updated version of the visualisation.
